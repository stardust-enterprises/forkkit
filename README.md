# Fukkit!

###### Forge + Bukkit! Fukkit!

## What the hell is this?!

Fukkit is a "Forge mod" *(actually a [ModLauncher 8](https://github.com/McModLauncher/modlauncher/tree/main-8.1.x) service)* that allows other Forge mods to access Bukkit plugins' classes.

## How do I use this?????

Simply drop the Fukkit jar into your server's `mods` folder, and you're good to go!

## Compatability

Fukkit has been developped for ModLauncher 8.1.x targetting [Mohist](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist) 1.16.5, and is not guaranteed to work on any other version.
